This is a really simple demo I created while reading over [adafruit's tutorial on multi-tasking in arduino](https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-the-arduino-part-1/overview). This tutorial was what really helped me wrap my head around state machines.

I also found [RalphBacon's repository](https://github.com/RalphBacon/ArduinoLibrary) and [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE3Dw0slhIc&t=3s) on creating A C++ library incredibly helpful as I ease back into C++ (haven't touched it for over a decade :P).
